    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Mul Naengmyeon or Mul Naengmyun (물냉면) is cold noodles served in a chilled broth made from beef and/or Korean radish water kimchi (dongchimi, 동치미).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>10 ounces (280 grams) dried naengmyeon noodles</li>
        <li>2 packets of liquid or powdered concentrated broth that comes with the package of naengmyeon noodles</li>
        <li>2 packets of mustard oil that comes with the package of naengmyeon noodles.</li>
        <li>English cucumber, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 Korean pear (or 2 bosc pears)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 hard-boiled egg, cut in halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, ground</li>
        <li>ice cubes</li>
    </uo>
    <h3>Make Broth</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the packets of the concentrated broth and put them into a bowl. Mix with 4 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Keep in the freezer for 4 to 5 hours so it gets slushy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare cucumber and pear garnishes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make quick pickled cucumbers by combining the sliced cucumber, kosher salt, ½ teaspoon sugar, and vinegar in a bowl. Mix it well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make sugar water by mixing 1 cup of water and 1 teaspoon sugar.</li>
        <li>Peel the pear and slice into halves. Slice one half into thin strips and soak them in the sugar water to keep them from going brown.</li>
        <li>Grate the other half of the pear and squeeze out the juice using a cotton cloth or cheesecloth. You should get about ½ cup of pear juice. If you use small bosc pears, use one for garnish and the other for pear juice.</li>
        <li>Take the bowl of broth out of the freezer. Squeeze some cucumber brine into the broth and add the pear juice.</li>
        <li>Mix well and put the broth back in the fridge or freezer until the noodles are ready</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare Noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and stir with a wooden spoon. Cover and let them cook for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take a sample to taste. When you chew the noodles, there shouldn’t be any hard stuff inside. Be sure not to overcook them or they’ll go soggy.</li>
        <li>Strain and rinse the noodles in cold running water until they aren’t slippery any more and are well cooled.</li>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with cold water and some ice cubes. Add the noodles and rinse them a final time.</li>
        <li>Drain the noodles and divide them into 2 large shallow bowls.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Put it Together</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the icy broth into each bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the cucumber and pear on top.</li>
        <li>Add a packet of mustard oil to each bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with some sesame seeds powder. Add a half egg on top of each bowl.</li>
        <li>Serve right away.</li>
    </ol>
